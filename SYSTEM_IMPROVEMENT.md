# System Self-Improvement Guide

You are improving the AIMA CodeGen system itself. Remember:

1. You are modifying `aima_codegen/` not a regular project `src/`
2. Preserve all existing functionality - only add, don't break
3. Run tests after changes: `python -m pytest aima_codegen/tests/`
4. Start with simple additions (markdown files) before code changes
5. Document every change clearly

## Implementation Status:

### ✅ Phase 1: Agent Guides (COMPLETED)
Created comprehensive documentation in `aima_codegen/agents/`:
- ✅ PLANNER.md - Planning best practices and waypoint decomposition
- ✅ CODEGEN.md - Code generation patterns and quality standards  
- ✅ TESTWRITER.md - Test writing standards and pytest best practices
- ✅ REVIEWER.md - Code review criteria and GitHub integration
- ✅ EXPLAINER.md - Explanation guidelines and communication strategies

### ✅ Phase 2: Logging Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
Enhanced all agent execute() methods with comprehensive telemetry:
- ✅ Added base logging infrastructure to BaseAgent class
- ✅ Captures input context, raw LLM responses, token usage
- ✅ Tracks decision points with reasoning and alternatives
- ✅ Records confidence levels for each execution
- ✅ Logs stored in `project_path/logs/agent_telemetry.jsonl`
- ✅ Automatic telemetry setup in Orchestrator for all agents

### ✅ Phase 3: Debrief System (COMPLETED)
Post-task self-assessment and improvement suggestions:
- ✅ Comprehensive debrief generation after each agent execution
- ✅ Self-assessment including confidence analysis and risk identification
- ✅ Decision quality evaluation and alternative approach suggestions
- ✅ Lessons learned capture (successes, challenges, improvements)
- ✅ Future recommendations for similar and follow-up tasks
- ✅ Structured JSON storage in `project_path/logs/debriefs/`

## New Infrastructure Added:

### Self-Improvement Commands
- `aima-codegen improve <feature>` - Self-improvement mode
- Available improvements: `agent-guides`, `basic-telemetry`, `debrief-system`
- Special project initialization for self-modification

### Enhanced Agent Capabilities
- **Telemetry Logging**: Comprehensive execution data capture
- **Decision Tracking**: Structured decision point recording with reasoning
- **Confidence Assessment**: Quantified confidence levels for all outputs
- **Self-Assessment**: Post-execution debriefs with improvement suggestions

### Data Structures
- **Agent Telemetry**: JSON logs with execution context and outcomes
- **Decision Points**: Timestamped choices with options and reasoning
- **Debriefs**: Structured self-assessments with lessons learned
- **Confidence Metrics**: Quantified assessment of task execution quality

## Usage Examples:

### Self-Improvement Mode
```bash
# Initialize self-improvement for a specific feature
aima-codegen improve agent-guides --budget 5.0

# The system will:
# 1. Create a special self-improvement project
# 2. Symlink src/ to the actual aima_codegen package
# 3. Run normal development process on the live system
```

### Telemetry Analysis
```bash
# View telemetry logs
cat ~/.AIMA_CodeGen/projects/SELF_IMPROVE_*/logs/agent_telemetry.jsonl

# View debriefs
ls ~/.AIMA_CodeGen/projects/SELF_IMPROVE_*/logs/debriefs/
```

## Architecture Benefits:

1. **Self-Awareness**: Agents now track their own decision-making process
2. **Continuous Learning**: Structured capture of lessons learned
3. **Quality Metrics**: Confidence levels provide execution quality indicators
4. **Process Improvement**: Debriefs suggest concrete improvements
5. **Transparency**: Full visibility into agent reasoning and choices
6. **Self-Modification**: Safe framework for system self-improvement

## Next Steps for Future Improvements:

1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualization of telemetry and debrief data
2. **Adaptive Confidence**: Dynamic confidence thresholds based on performance
3. **Learning Integration**: Use historical data to improve future decisions
4. **Advanced Metrics**: More sophisticated quality and performance indicators
5. **Cross-Agent Learning**: Share insights between different agent types
